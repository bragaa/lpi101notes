# Devices, Devices drivers, Kernel modules

## Tasks
- Identify device, device files and related information
- Identify kernel modules
- Understand kernel filesystems,
- Understand devices management system (udev)

---

## Computer main components
A computer is made up of the following:
- CPU + RAM
- I/O buses for connecting devices: PCI, USB, PCIe
- computer firmware and devices configuration on NVRAM
- a boot media (storing the operating system kernel+initramfs)
- disk devices (for the root filesystem, additional devices)

## Mass storage devices
- Controllers to computer interfaces
	- **Serial AT attachment** interface (SATA) (sd)
	- **Small Computer System Interface** (SCSI)
	- Older: Parallel ATA (PATA), Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) (hd)
	- External SATA (eSATA) for external devices
- Removable devices (floppy, Zip, or CD/DVD drives) uses SATA attachment.
- disk drives can be **partitioned** to divide their space for different uses, or **combined** into arrays to make a redundant storage or to make several smaller disks appear as a larger one. Involved technologies are **RAID**, **Logical Volume Manager** (LVM).
--- 

## Solid-state drives (SSDs)
- Use persistent memory technology (flash or 3D XPoint by Intel)
- Lighter, faster (more IOPS), use less power, less-prone to mechanical failure
- Attachable via the following buses: PCI Express 4.0, USB 3.0 or Serial ATA 3.0
	-  **M.2** or mSATA form factors
- Driver to device firmware interface (aka host controller protocol):
	- the **non-volatile memory host controller interface**, aka **NVM Express** (NVMe)
	- the **advanced host controller interface** (AHCI), being replaced by NVMe
---

## Handling PCI devices during boot
- POST (Power on self test) procedure,
- queried for dev id, capabilities, requirements, etc.
- assigned required ressources: IRQ numbers, DMA regions, I/O ports
---

## PCI Devices
- PCI device attributes (exposed by the PCI device through the host controller):
	- Physical attachment, **[[bus]:][device][.[func]]**, 0:, 0:3, :3.*
	<!--		- Sometimes with a domain: [[[[domain]:]bus]:][device][.[func]]-->
	- **PCI ID**, [vendor]:[device][:class] (1014:003E)
	- DMA memory range, I/O ports, Interrupt requests lines, capabilities,
	- driver in use,
- `lspci` displays PCI buses and devices connected to them.
	- uses the **universal PCI IDs list** to resolve numeric ids
	- tree format following BDF address
- Universal PCI IDs list is used for resolution of PCI ID to text
	- Cached locally in `/usr/share/misc/pci.ids`, updated using `update-pciids`
	- Resolution also done using DNS
---

## Tour on PCI devices
```bash
#update the local cache of the pci identifiers database
update-pciids 
# display pci devices, most verbose format
lspci -vvv
# list devices from vendor 8086 (Intel Corporation)
lsusb -d 8086:*:*
# lspci devices in tree format 
lspci -t
#lspci devices and show PCI vendor and device codes as both numbers and names
lspci -nn
# lspci devices on bus 0, show verbose tree format
lspci -tvv -s :00
```
---

## Universal Serial Bus Overview
- USB Protocol
	- support USB 1,2,3
	- USB 1.1 (12Mbps), driver OHCI(UHCI)
	- USB 2.0 (480Mbps), driver EHCI
	- USB 3.0 (5Gbps), driver XHCI
- device classes
---

## USB Devices
- Device attributes:
	- address: [[bus]:][devnum]
	- USB Id: [vendor]:[product]
	- class: used for selecting driver
- `lsusb` displays USB buses and devices
	- uses USB ID list for name resolution (from `usbutils` package maintainers)
	- tree view
- use `update-usbids` to update `/var/lib/usbutils/usb.ids`
---

## Tour on USB devices
```bash
lsusb -vv 
lsusb -s bus:devnum
lsusb -d vendor:product
# display infos on connected usb devices
lsusb -v | grep -E '\<(Bus|iProduct|bDeviceClass|bDeviceProtocol)'
sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/usb/devices | grep -E "^([TSPD]:.*|)$"
```
---

## Loadable kernel modules
- object files used to extend the Kernel functionnalities
- offers drivers for devices, filesystem, scheduling algorithms, memory management,
- dynamically (un)loaded at runtime to adapt to hardware configuration or user requirements
- modular, may depend on each others, (dependency management)
- a minimal set is loaded from the initial RAM disk to access and mount the root filesystem
---

## Managing kernel modules
- current kernel version and release: `uname -a`
	- `lsb_release` for distribution specific information
- `lsmod`: shows loaded modules (reformatting `/proc/modules`)
- `modinfo`: show informations (key/value pairs) on the given module (name or file)
- `modprobe`: load or unload modules and handle dependencies
- `depmod`: parse modules and builds dependency tree
- `insmod`, `rmmod`: deprecated in favor of `modprobe`
- `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)` contains modules for the current kernel.
- `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.builtin` lists core drivers which are built into the current kernel.
- `/etc/modules` lists modules to be loaded at boot time and their respective arguments (device configuration like IRQ and I/O ports)	
---

## A tour on linux kernel modules
```bash
uname -a
# show what happens if brtrfs is loaded, does not actually load it.
modprobe -v --dry-run brtrfs
# show dependencies of ahci
modprobe --show-depends ahci
modinfo ahci | grep depends
# remove module (rmmod will do the same, but fails if other modules depends on autofs4)
modprobe -r autofs4
# load module thinkfan (a module on ThinkPad laptops for managing fan), with the given parameter
modprobe thinkfan fan_control=1

```
---

## Kernel pseudo-filesystems
- The kernel exports and maintains runtime information (devices, drivers, processes, kernel structures, etc.) in raw text files
- Different **virtual filesystems**: `/sys`, `/proc`, `/dev`
- Information nicely formatted by many programs: `sysctl`, `lspci`, `lsusb`, `uname`, `lshw`, `lsdev`, `ps`, `lsmod`, etc. (you may also read them directly or modify)
- Allows some parameters to be changed at runtime, using the `sysctl` command (accessing `/proc/sys/`).
- There are other means to communicate with the kernel (netlink sockets, system calls)

---

## procfs and sysfs
- information on processes and kernel data structures (although many of them moved to the `/sys/` filesystem)
- procfs is usually mounted at `/proc/`
- procfs provides the following informations to help diagnose hardware issues:
	- **interrupts requests identifiers** (IRQs) assignment and usage, `/proc/interrupts`
	- the registered *direct memory access* (DMA) channels, `/proc/dma`
	- list of assigned I/O port, in `/proc/ioports`. 
- `procinfo`, `lsdev` and `socklist` are frontends to extract information from `/proc`
---

## A tour on procfs
```bash
ls ‑l /proc/$$/ | head ‑n 15
cat /proc/$$/cmdline
/proc/interrupts
/proc/cpuinfo
/sbin/sysctl -w kernel.hostname="example.com" # /proc/sys/kernel/hostname

```
---

## User space device manager (udev)
- how to respond to 'closing the lid', 'battery reaching threshold', 'plugged a cable', 'plugged a removable media'?, etc.
- when a device state changes, the driver notifies user programs, allowing them to act upon
- decision is implemented as user-provided rules, an example from `/lib/udev/rules.d/80-ifupdown.rules`:
```bash
SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add|remove", RUN+="ifupdown-hotplug"
```
---

## User space device manager (udev)
- **udev** is the user space devices manager for Linux. Consists of:
	- `systemd-udevd.service` or `udevd`: the daemon program, gets udev events, responds as rules suggest
	- default udev rules in `/lib/udev/rules.d`
	- local udev rules (may override defaults) in `/etc/udev/rules.d`
	- volatile runtime rules `/run/udev/rules.d`
	- udev main configuration `/etc/udev/udev.config`
	- `udevadm` program is an administration tool for udevd

---
## Notes on device management in Linux
- The /dev filesystem contains a device files for each device detected by the kernel during boot.
- devices falls in two categories: character and block devices.
- character devices are those for which no buffering or storage is performed (typically)
- block devices are randomly accessed, but character devices are not required to be, though some are.
- filesystems can only be mounted if they are on block devices.
---

## A tour in udev system
```bash
udevadm info --query=all --name=/dev/sda
udevadm monitor --kernel
# show device types (c,b)
ls -l /dev
```
---


## Additional commands
```bash
$ egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
$ ls -l /sys/dev/char/81\:0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Dec 18 17:00 81:0 -> ../../devices/platform/soc/4c006000.dcmi/video4linux/video0
# lists the devices supported in the kernel, their majors,
$ cat /proc/devices 
```
