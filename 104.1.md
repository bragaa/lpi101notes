# 104.1: Partitions and Filesystems
---

## Block devices and filesystems
- **block devices** provides random access to fixed-size units of data, **blocks**
	- typically storage devices
	- disks, partitions of disk, volumes created using LVM or RAID
	- contrasts to **character devices**
- to make a file-oriented storage out of a block device, we need a filesystem:
	- install data structures to track blocks allocations, file structure,
	- various types: ext/2/3/4, NTFS,
	- Linux supports most of them, via loadable kernel modules
- kernel makes filesystems accessible on demand via a *mount* operation
---

## A tour on filesystems
```bash
findmnt
# list mounted ext4 fs.
mount -l -t ext4
# list block devices, their fs, showing full path of devices, topology info
# recommended over blkid, as it reads from /sys/block -> more comprhensive
lsblk -ftp
blikd
# prints all /etc/fstab filesystems and converts LABEL= and UUID= tags to the real device names
findmnt --fstab --evaluate
# prints all /etc/fstab filesystems where the mountpoint is /mnt/foo.
findmnt --fstab --target /mnt/foo
# prints all NFS filesystems defined in /etc/fstab
findmnt --fstab -t nfs
# print the major:minor of the device mounted at /rep if any
mountpoint -d /rep
# show the inodes statistics on /dev/sda1
df -i /dev/sda1
# compute . directory usage at a 1 level depth, human readable output, with a total at the end
du -hc --max-depth=1 .
```
---

## Disk partitions
- A **disk partition** of a disk is a contiguous space on disk purposefully created to
	- install different filesystems
	- implement linux installation recommendations
	- create portions for physical volumes for LVM
- A partitionned disk have **partition table** describing for each partition:
	- label, universally unique id (UUID),
	- type, (not to be confused with the contained fs type)
	- addresses of start/end blocks,
	- various flags (boot/active, esp,)
- We may also want to keep unallocated space (recommended with LVM)
---

## A tour on disk partitions
```bash
# graphical reprensentation of disks and partitions
gparted
parted -l  /dev/sda
sfdisk # script oriented tool (as opposed to mendu driven)
cfdisk # curses-based tool
gdisk
fdisk
partprobe --dry-run -s # reloads a device partition table
kpartx

# show information about partitions using the specified format
lsblk -o name,type,fstype,label,partlabel,model,mountpoint,size
# show filesystems in partitions
lsblk --fs
```
---

## Partitionning formats
- partitionning formats: "dos" (aka MBR) or the newer GUID Partition Table (GPT).
- MBR is limited to 4 partitions, each limited to 4TB
	- partially solved by introducing primary/extended partition distinction
- GPT supports larger partitions, with up to 128 partitions.
	- backward compatible
	- redundant partition table
---

## The GPT format:
- Globally Unique ID Partition Table

## Managing partitions
- Creating, resizing, deleting partitions
---

## Filesystem concepts (ext4)
- a file: inode + data blocks or extents
- inode: stores file attributes
- superblock : stores filesystem metadata
- blocks bitmap: index to track allocation of data blocks
- inode bitmap: index to track allocation of inodes
- journal: an area on disk used to reduce filesystem errors recovery time
---

## Filesystems management
- create a filesystem
	- `mke2fs`, `mkfs.ext3`, `mkfs.xfs`,
	- `/etc/mke2fs.conf` defines defaults for `mke2fs`
	- `mkfs` ?
- get filesystem information (superblock and for block groups): `dumpe2fs`
- tune filesystem parameters (resize, #block groups, extents, )
	- `tune2fs`
	- `tune2fs -l` gives the adjustable parameters
- check and repair filesystem consistency: `fsck`
- interactively debug fs operations: `debugfs`
---

## Filesystems management in practice
```bash
# make fs of type ext3 on partition /dev/sda1
mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sda1
mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda1
mke2fs -j /dev/sda1 # a journalled ext2 fs, which is ext3 (the first to have a journal.)
# make fs of type FAT on partition /dev/sda1
mkfs.msdos /dev/sda1
mkdosfs /dev/sda

# the mkfs tool is deprecated  in favour of filesystem specific mkfs.<type> tools.
mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sda1
du
df
```
---

## Check and repair filesystems
- filesystems can get corrupted if a driver or device are accidentally stopped:
	- blocks allocated but not unused in any file,
	- files created but not referenced in directories (orphan files),
- filesystem should be repaired before mounted unless read-only is desired
	- repair does not mean recover data, but reach a consistent state
	- `fsck` parses the entire filesystem structures to find and repair inconsistencies
	- journalled systems reduce time required for repair
- each filesystem type has a *filesystem consistency checker* (fsck):
	- `fsck` is a fronted for `e2fsck`, `fsck.ext3`, `fsck.fat`, `fsck.btrfs`, etc. 
	- `/etc/e2fsck.conf` defines defaults for `e2fsck`
- the `/etc/fstab` tells whether the fs must be checked, and in which order (0: no check, 1 is the first, and so on).
- fsck typically invoked by `systemd-mount` or `mount`
---

## Checking and repairing filesystems
```bash
tune2fs -l /dev/sda1 | grep 'Filesystem state:'
fsck device
fsck -As
fsck -y /dev/sda1
# perform consistency check with marking of badblocks 
e2fsck -c /dev/sda1
# find bad blocks in /dev/sad1 from blokc no 1 until block no 1000. do not use it directly, but called by e2fsck instead. 
badblocks -b 4096 /dev/sda1 1 1000
```
---

## Filesystems mounting
- mount a filesystem = load a filesystem and make it accessible
- mount arguments: volume id, mount point, fs type, mount options, passno, dump.
- during mount, the adequate driver is loaded (kernel module)
- mount and unmount take place at boot time or manually
- `systemd-mount` is responsible for mounting at boot time the filesystems.
	- `/etc/fstab`: the fs table, used for dynamic mount
- `mount`
---

## A tour on the filesystems table
- each fs is described by: `filesystem, mount point, type, options, dump, pass`
- filesystem is described by:
	- label
	- uuid
- mount options: auto/noauto, defaults, ro/rw, nodev, nosuid, user/nouser, excec/noexec, async, noatime. (some depends on the fs type)
- `pass` defines the order in which (and whether) the fs consistency must be checked
- `dump` defines options to be used by the backup tool (dump). (0 means no backup, which is the default)
---

## Mouting filesystems in practice
```bash
# displays currently mounted fs (from /proc/mounts)
mount 
# mount all /etc/fstab devices, except those indicated as noauto (in options)
mount -a 
lsblk --fs # show fs
lsblk -n -o name,fstype,mountpoint,label,uuid -r
blkid
findmnt # seaches in mounted fs
# mount a MS-DOS filesystem floppy disk to mount point /mnt. /mnt must exist
mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /mnt
# mount the /dev/fd0 filesystem according to the correspondig entry in /etc/fstab
mount /dev/fd0 
# change mount options for root filesystem
mount -o remount,rw / 
# mount a CD-ROM ISO9660 image file like a CD-ROM (via the loop device)
mount -t iso9660 -o ro,loop=/dev/loop0 cd.img /mnt/cdrom
# bind mount path to a second location
mount --bind srcfolder dstfolder
# mount a remote NFS directory
mount -t nfs <host>:<remote-dir> <local-dir>
# mount an iso file. loop 
mount -o loop disk1.iso /mnt/disk
# monitors and print all the mount, unmount, remount and move events on occurring on /mnt/foo.
findmnt --poll --mountpoint /mnt/foo
#eject removable media located at /mnt/cdrom
eject /mnt/cdrom
umount /mnt/vm
```

# Overview of the major filesystems
---

## ext/ext2/ext3/ext4 Filesystem
- Various types of filesystems:
	- ext/ext2/ext3/ext4,
	- Btrfs, xfs,
	- FAT, NTFS, ReFS
- Multiple features:
	- which attributes do they consider,
	- versionned storage,
	- file size limits,
	- fault tolerance,
	- improved read/write performance,
	- security (encryption, access control,)
- drivers provided as kernel modules
- virtual file system serves as a dispatcher to the corresponding driver
---

## ext2,3,4
---

## Btrfs
- stands for B-Tree File System
- features:
	- file can have checksums (computed at write, checked at read.)
	- you can take **snapshots** of the filesystem, so that you can restore the filesystem state (do not confuse with backups: backups are kept offline, i.e. out of the filesystem underlying volume, while snapshots are kept inline.)
	- based on **copy-on-write**, (provides for better perf in copy, space is used more efficiently, used for snapshots)
	- built-in volumes management: meaning that a single btrfs volume can be split into distinct subvolumes, and multiple physical volumes can be grouped into a single btrfs volume.
---

## A note on the swap area
- The **swap area** is an area on disk (either allocated as a file or as a dedicated partition) used by the operating system to extend the RAM size, in order to make a larger memory space for processes (creating what we call **virtual memory**). In Linux, the swap space is typicall a disk partition of type 0x82 (but can also be a file). There is no filesystem there in, just raw data.
- A swap partition can be created via any partitioning tool e.g. fdisk.
- In order to set up a swap on a linux system (assuming you are using a swap file,) you have to follow these steps: create a regular file with root:root ownership and 0600 permissions, prepare the file for swap (some internal structure have to be initialized), then activate swap on the system (either immediately with `swapon` or via `/etc/fstab` file).
---

## Swap area in practice
```bash
# this sequence creates and initializes a swap file
dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=65536
chmod 0600 /swapfile
mkswap /swapfile
swapon /swapfile
echo "/swapfile   swap   swap  defaults  0 0" >> /etc/fstab
systemctl daemon-reload
# end
#show the system overall swap usage
top # then type 'm' to show the overall swap usage 
free
# show the swap areas
swapon -s
```
