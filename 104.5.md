# 104.5/6/7: Files management
---

## Files attributes
- filesystems stores the following attributes for each file
    - inode number
    - name
    - size
    - atime, mtime, ctime
    - owner user, owner group
    - type
    - permissions
---

## A tour on file attributes
- format specifiers: %n name, %a %A access rights in octal/human readable, %F file type, %s size, %i inode number, %x %y %z atime,mtime,ctime
```bash
# use the format given by -c
stat -c '%A %a %n' .
# applies to filesystem containing .
stat -f . 
# sort files in .. based on ctime, reverse order, all files, long format display with decorators
ls -larF --sort=time --time=ctime  ..
basename -s .h include/stdio.h
dirname 
realpath /../
```
---

## Access control attributes
- only the owner or root can changes ownership and permissions
- ![access permissions explained](https://www.booleanworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/classes.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb20)
- a directory is just a file with a special content, where
 - r: list content
 - w: modify content
 - x: open the directry ('cd' into it)
- octal notation vs symbolic notation of permissions (rwx=4+2+1=7)
---

## Changing access permissions
```bash
chmod o+x file
chmod 661 file
chmod u=rwx,go=x file
# similar to chmod ugo-x file
chmod -x file
#applies recursively the operation to dir and every file underneath
chmod -R g+x dir
#set ownership of file 
chown user:group file
chgrp group file
# changes owner, recursively, making change on the symlink instead of the target (no-dereference)
chown -hR root ./workspace
# report only when changes done
chown -c --from=user:group ./workspace
```
---

## Special access permissions
- restricted deletion flag (aka sticky bit) (--- --- --t, 1000), applies to directories
 - it prevents unprivileged users (ie. non root) from removing or renaming a file in the directory unless they own the file or the directory.
- setGID (--- --s ---, 2000)
 - for executables: will run using the owner group id
 - for directories: files and subdirs created in it will inherit the group id
- setUID (--s --- ---, 4000 ), applies to files
 - for executables: will run using the owner identity
- setuid, setgid permissions are only meaningful for executables. however, when x permissions are removed, an 's' permission is replaced with 'S'. 't' permissions becomes 'T'.
---

## file creation mask
- default permissions for files are defined by the **user mask** (umask)
- used to remove some permissions from the reference permissions (666 for regular files and 777 for dirs), applies only to newly created files
![rigth](https://danielmiessler.com/images/permissions.png)
- 'umask -S' gives the default permissions (automaticall add the x for directories as we wan to get in them)
 - shell dependent, user dependant, can be modified in file shell initialization files or within session.
---

## File creation mask in practice
```bash
# 022 permissions will be removed from the default permissions
umask 022
# will be give the actual permissions
umask -S
```
---

## hard and symbolic links
- symbolic links allows links to refer to file names in other volumes (was not possible with physical links)
- physically linked files are actually a single file (one inode), but referenced from different directories (names are not stored in inodes)
- some commands (chown, find, ls, etc.) have options to tell how to process symbolic links: shall links be followed, which file attributes will be used in find, etc.
- security issue
- stale links
- prperties on inode numbers, statu, date, constraint on file existence, etc.
- links are used for backup, compatibility, commands substitution, like for ext2
---

## Links in practice
```bash
readlink
unlink
```
---

## FHS
---

## locating files
- two file search methodes:
    - `find`: multi-criteria, traverses the entire filesystem
    - `locate`: uses name, based on index, which must be regularly updated
- `which` search for file in PATH variable, 
- `whereis` searches for sources, binaries, manuals in PATH, MANPATH and across well-knwon places in FHS
- `type`
---

## Locating files in practice
```bash
whereis -u -ms -M /usr/man/man1 -S /usr/src -f *
```
