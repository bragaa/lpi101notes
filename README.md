# lpi101notes
This repository aims to be as a place for the lpi-101 learning materials written by the gcr@enig students. I've created a dedicated file for each of the exam obejectives.

Use the provided repository structure in order to gradually prepare for the exam. Just pick an item, *read* about it from the widely available materials on the web, *practice* on on your system, then document it in its respective file, put examples and links, etc. 

Once finished with one or more files, you can submit your additions or changes and ask for a merge into the main repository. I'll be in charge of selecting best additions. 

You can suggest other items and create file for them. Just keep the convention for file naming: objectivenumber-text-description.md or extra-text-description.md.

Files are written in markdown (you can use sublime text or vscode with github/git plugins).
