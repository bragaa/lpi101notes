# lpi101notes
This repository aims to be a place for lpi-101 self-study materials written by and for gcr@enig students. I've created a dedicated file for each of the [exam objectives](https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/exam-101-objectives).

Use the provided repository structure in order to gradually prepare for the exam: pick an item, *learn* it from the widely available materials on the web, *practice* on your system, then document it in its respective file, put examples and links, etc. Make it as clear as possible for your colleagues to read and start with. Some files already contain starting materials or guiding remarks.

Once finished with an item, you can submit your additions or changes and ask for a merge into the main repository. I'll be in charge of selecting best additions, correcting, etc. 

Feel free to add other items (create files for them). Just keep the convention for file naming: `objectivenumber-text-description.md` or `extra-text-description.md`. 

Files are written in markdown. You can use sublime text or vscode with github/git plugins.
